The proposed databases can associate any input\\nwith some output. In the first half part of discussion, an algorithm of self-organization is\\nproposed. From an aspect of hardware, it produces a new style of neural network. In the\\nlatter half part, an applicability to handwritten letter recognition and that to an autonomous\\nmobile robot system are demonstrated.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nLet a mapping f : X -+ Y be given. Here, X is a finite or infinite set, and Y is another\\nfinite or infinite set. A learning machine observes any set of pairs (x, y) sampled randomly\\nfrom X x Y. (X x Y means the Cartesian product of X and Y.) And, it computes some\\nestimate j : X -+ Y of f to make small, the estimation error in some measure.\\nUsually we say that: the faster the decrease of estimation error with increase of the number of samples, the better the learning machine. However, such expression on performance\\nis incomplete. Since, it lacks consideration on the candidates of J of j assumed preliminarily. Then, how should we find out good learning machines? To clarify this conception,\\nlet us discuss for a while on some types of learning machines. And, let us advance the\\nunderstanding of the self-organization of associative database .\\n. Parameter Type\\nAn ordinary type of learning machine assumes an equation relating x\\'s and y\\'s with\\nparameters being indefinite, namely, a structure of f. It is equivalent to define implicitly a\\nset F of candidates of\\n(F is some subset of mappings from X to Y.) And, it computes\\nvalues of the parameters based on the observed samples. We call such type a parameter\\ntype.\\nFor a learning machine defined well, if F 3 f, j approaches f as the number of samples\\nincreases. In the alternative case, however, some estimation error remains eternally. Thus,\\na problem of designing a learning machine returns to find out a proper structure of f in this\\nsense.\\nOn the other hand, the assumed structure of f is demanded to be as compact as possible\\nto achieve a fast learning. In other words, the number of parameters should be small. Since,\\nif the parameters are few, some j can be uniquely determined even though the observed\\nsamples are few. However, this demand of being proper contradicts to that of being compact.\\nConsequently, in the parameter type, the better the compactness of the assumed structure\\nthat is proper, the better the learning machine. This is the most elementary conception\\nwhen we design learning machines .\\n\\n1.\\n\\n. Universality and Ordinary Neural Networks\\nNow suppose that a sufficient knowledge on f is given though J itself is unknown. In\\nthis case, it is comparatively easy to find out proper and compact structures of J. In the\\nalternative case, however, it is sometimes difficult. A possible solution is to give up the\\ncompactness and assume an almighty structure that can cover various 1\\'s. A combination\\nof some orthogonal bases of the infinite dimension is such a structure. Neural networks 1 ,2\\nare its approximations obtained by truncating finitely the dimension for implementation.\\n\\n? American Institute of Physics 1988\\n\\n\\x0c768\\nA main topic in designing neural networks is to establish such desirable structures of 1.\\nThis work includes developing practical procedures that compute values of coefficients from\\nthe observed samples. Such discussions are :flourishing since 1980 while many efficient methods have been proposed. Recently, even hardware units computing coefficients in parallel\\nfor speed-up are sold, e.g., ANZA, Mark III, Odyssey and E-1.\\nNevertheless, in neural networks, there always exists a danger of some error remaining\\neternally in estimating /. Precisely speaking, suppose that a combination of the bases of a\\nfinite number can define a structure of 1 essentially. In other words, suppose that F 3 /, or\\n1 is located near F. In such case, the estimation error is none or negligible. However, if 1\\nis distant from F, the estimation error never becomes negligible. Indeed, many researches\\nreport that the following situation appears when 1 is too complex. Once the estimation\\nerror converges to some value (> 0) as the number of samples increases, it decreases hardly\\neven though the dimension is heighten. This property sometimes is a considerable defect of\\nneural networks .\\n. Recursi ve Type\\nThe recursive type is founded on another methodology of learning that should be as\\nfollows. At the initial stage of no sample, the set Fa (instead of notation F) of candidates\\nof I equals to the set of all mappings from X to Y. After observing the first sample\\n(Xl, Yl) E X x Y, Fa is reduced to Fi so that I(xt) = Yl for any I E F. After observing\\nthe second sample (X2\\' Y2) E X x Y, Fl is further reduced to F2 so that i(xt) = Yl and\\nI(X2) = Y2 for any I E F. Thus, the candidate set F becomes gradually small as observation\\nof samples proceeds. The after observing i-samples, which we write\\nis one of the most\\nlikelihood estimation of 1 selected in fi;. Hence, contrarily to the parameter type, the\\nrecursive type guarantees surely that j approaches to 1 as the number of samples increases.\\nThe recursive type, if observes a sample (x\" yd, rewrites values 1,-l(X),S to I,(x)\\'s for\\nsome x\\'s correlated to the sample. Hence, this type has an architecture composed of a rule\\nfor rewriting and a free memory space. Such architecture forms naturally a kind of database\\nthat builds up management systems of data in a self-organizing way. However, this database\\ndiffers from ordinary ones in the following sense. It does not only record the samples already\\nobserved, but computes some estimation of l(x) for any x E X. We call such database an\\nassociative database.\\nThe first subject in constructing associative databases is how we establish the rule for\\nrewri ting. For this purpose, we adap t a measure called the dissimilari ty. Here, a dissimilari ty\\nmeans a mapping d : X x X -+ {reals > O} such that for any (x, x) E X x X, d(x, x) > 0\\nwhenever l(x) t /(x). However, it is not necessarily defined with a single formula. It is\\ndefinable with, for example, a collection of rules written in forms of \"if? .. then?? .. \"\\nThe dissimilarity d defines a structure of 1 locally in X x Y. Hence, even though\\nthe knowledge on f is imperfect, we can re:flect it on d in some heuristic way. Hence,\\ncontrarily to neural networks, it is possible to accelerate the speed of learning by establishing\\nd well. Especially, we can easily find out simple d\\'s for those l\\'s which process analogically\\ninformation like a human. (See the applications in this paper.) And, for such /\\'s, the\\nrecursive type shows strongly its effectiveness.\\nWe denote a sequence of observed samples by (Xl, Yd, (X2\\' Y2),???. One of the simplest\\nconstructions of associative databases after observing i-samples (i = 1,2,.,,) is as follows.\\n\\ni\\n\\ni\"\\n\\nI,\\n\\nAlgorithm 1. At the initial stage, let So be the empty set.

However, the computation time\\ngrows proportionally to the size of Si. The second subject in constructing associative\\ndatabases is what addressing rule we should employ to economize the computation time. In\\nthe subsequent chapters, a construction of associative database for this purpose is proposed.\\nIt manages data in a form of binary tree.\\n\\nSELF-ORGANIZATION OF ASSOCIATIVE DATABASE\\nGiven a sample sequence (Xl, Yl), (X2\\' Y2), .. \" the algorithm for constructing associative\\ndatabase is as follows.\\n\\nAlgorithm 3,\\'\\n\\nStep I(Initialization): Let (x[root], y[root]) = (Xl, Yd.

Then, we obtain a new style of neural network with gate elements\\nbeing randomly connected by this algorithm.\\n\\nLETTER RECOGNITION\\nRecen tly, the vertical slitting method for recognizing typographic English letters3 , the\\nelastic matching method for recognizing hand written discrete English letters4 , the global\\ntraining and fuzzy logic search method for recognizing Chinese characters written in square\\nstyleS, etc. are published.

An experiment result.\\n\\nAn image scanner takes a document image (Fig. 1). The letter recognizer uses a parallelogram window that at least can cover the maximal letter (Fig. 2), and processes the\\nsequence of letters while shifting the window. That is, the recognizer scans a word in a\\nslant direction. And, it places the window so that its left vicinity may be on the first black\\npoint detected. Then, the window catches a letter and some part of the succeeding letter.\\nIf recognition of the head letter is performed, its end position, namely, the boundary line\\nbetween two letters becomes known. Hence, by starting the scanning from this boundary\\nand repeating the above operations, the recognizer accomplishes recursively the task. Thus\\nthe major problem comes to identifying the head letter in the window.\\nConsidering it, we define the following.\\n? Regard window images as x\\'s, and define X accordingly.\\n? For a (x, x) E X x X, denote by B a black point in the left area from the boundary on\\nwindow image X. Project each B onto window image x. Then, measure the Euclidean\\ndistance 6 between fj and a black point B on x being the closest to B. Let d(x, x) be\\nthe summation of 6\\'s for all black points B\\'s on x divided by the number of B\\'s.\\n? Regard couples of the \"reading\" and the position of boundary as y\\'s, and define Y\\naccordingly.\\nAn operator teaches the recognizer in interaction the relation between window image and\\nreading& boundary with algorithm 3. Precisely, if the recalled reading is incorrect, the\\noperator teaches a correct reading via the console. Moreover, if the boundary position is\\nincorrect, he teaches a correct position via the mouse.\\nFig. 1 shows partially a document image used in this experiment. Fig. 3 shows the\\nchange of the number of nodes and that of the recognition rate defined as the relative\\nfrequency of correct answers in the past 1000 trials. Speciiications of the window are height\\n= 20dot, width = 10dot, and slant angular = 68deg. In this example, the levels of tree\\nwere distributed in 6-19 at time 4000 and the recognition rate converged to about 74%.\\nExperimentally, the recognition rate converges to about 60-85% in most cases, and to 95% at\\na rare case. However, it does not attain 100% since, e.g., \"c\" and \"e\" are not distinguishable\\nbecause of excessive lluctuation in writing. If the consistency of the x, y-relation is not\\nassured like this, the number of nodes increases endlessly (d. Fig. 3). Hence, it is clever to\\nstop the learning when the recognition rate attains some upper limit. To improve further\\nthe recognition rate, we must consider the spelling of words. It is one of future subjects.\\n\\n\\x0c771\\n\\nOBSTACLE AVOIDING MOVEMENT\\nVarious systems of camera type autonomous mobile robot are reported flourishingly6-1O.\\nThe system made up by the authors (Fig. 4) also belongs to this category. Now, in mathematical methodologies, we solve usually the problem of obstacle avoiding movement as\\na cost minimization problem under some cost criterion established artificially. Contrarily,\\nthe self-organization of associative database reproduces faithfully the cost criterion of an\\noperator. Therefore, motion of the robot after learning becomes very natural.\\nNow, the length, width and height of the robot are all about O.7m, and the weight is\\nabout 30kg. The visual angle of camera is about 55deg. The robot has the following three\\nfactors of motion. It turns less than ?30deg, advances less than 1m, and controls speed less\\nthan 3km/h. The experiment was done on the passageway of wid th 2.5m inside a building\\nwhich the authors\\' laboratories exist in (Fig. 5). Because of an experimental intention, we\\narrange boxes, smoking stands, gas cylinders, stools, handcarts, etc. on the passage way at\\nrandom. We let the robot take an image through the camera, recall a similar image, and\\ntrace the route preliminarily recorded on it. For this purpose, we define the following.\\n? Let the camera face 28deg downward to take an image, and process it through a low\\npass filter. Scanning vertically the filtered image from the bottom to the top, search\\nthe first point C where the luminance changes excessively. Then, su bstitu te all points\\nfrom the bottom to C for white, and all points from C to the top for black (Fig. 6).\\n(If no obstacle exists just in front of the robot, the white area shows the \\'\\'free\\'\\' area\\nwhere the robot can move around.) Regard binary 32 x 32dot images processed thus\\nas x\\'s, and define X accordingly.\\n? For every (x, x) E X x X, let d(x, x) be the number of black points on the exclusive-or\\nimage between x and X.\\n? Regard as y\\'s the images obtained by drawing routes on images x\\'s, and define Y\\naccordingly.\\nThe robot superimposes, on the current camera image x, the route recalled for x, and\\ninquires the operator instructions. The operator judges subjectively whether the suggested\\nroute is appropriate or not. In the negative answer, he draws a desirable route on x with the\\nmouse to teach a new y to the robot. This opera.tion defines implicitly a sample sequence\\nof (x, y) reflecting the cost criterion of the operator.\\n\\n.::l\" !\\n-\\n\\nIibUBe\\n\\n_. -\\n\\n22\\n\\n11\\n\\nRoan\\n\\n12\\n\\n{-\\n\\n13\\n\\nStationary uni t\\n\\nFig. 4.

Processing for\\nposition identification.\\nWe define the satisfaction rate by the relative frequency of acceptable suggestions of\\nroute in the past 100 trials. In a typical experiment, the change of satisfaction rate showed\\na similar tendency to Fig. 3, and it attains about 95% around time 800. Here, notice that\\nthe rest 5% does not mean directly the percentage of collision. (In practice, we prevent the\\ncollision by adopting some supplementary measure.) At time 800, the number of nodes was\\n145, and the levels of tree were distributed in 6-17.\\nThe proposed method reflects delicately various characters of operator. For example, a\\nrobot trained by an operator 0 moves slowly with enough space against obstacles while one\\ntrained by another operator 0\\' brushes quickly against obstacles. This fact gives us a hint\\non a method of printing \"characters\" into machines.\\nPOSITION IDENTIFICATION\\nThe robot can identify its position by recalling a similar landscape with the position data\\nto a camera image. For this purpose, in principle, it suffices to regard camera images and\\nposition data as x\\'s and y\\'s, respectively. However, the memory capacity is finite in actual\\ncompu ters. Hence, we cannot but compress the camera images at a slight loss of information.\\nSuch compression is admittable as long as the precision of position identification is in an\\nacceptable area. Thus, the major problem comes to find out some suitable compression\\nmethod.\\nIn the experimental environment (Fig. 5), juts are on the passageway at intervals of\\n3.6m, and each section between adjacent juts has at most one door. The robot identifies\\nroughly from a surrounding landscape which section itself places in. And, it uses temporarily\\na triangular surveying technique if an exact measure is necessary. To realize the former task,\\nwe define the following .\\n? Turn the camera to take a panorama image of 360deg. Scanning horizontally the\\ncenter line, substitute the points where the luminance excessively changes for black\\nand the other points for white (Fig. 1). Regard binary 360dot line images processed\\nthus as x\\'s, and define X accordingly.\\n? For every (x, x) E X x X, project each black point A on x onto x. And, measure the\\nEuclidean distance 6 between A and a black point A on x being the closest to A. Let\\nthe summation of 6 be S. Similarly, calculate S by exchanging the roles of x and X.\\nDenoting the numbers of A\\'s and A\\'s respectively by nand n, define\\n\\n\\x0c773\\n\\nd(x, x) =\\n\\n~(~\\n+ ~).\\n2 n\\nn\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n? Regard positive integers labeled on sections as y\\'s (cf. Fig. 5), and define Y accordingly.\\nIn the learning mode, the robot checks exactly its position with a counter that is reset periodically by the operator. The robot runs arbitrarily on the passageways within 18m area\\nand learns the relation between landscapes and position data. (Position identification beyond 18m area is achieved by crossing plural databases one another.) This task is automatic\\nexcepting the periodic reset of counter, namely, it is a kind of learning without teacher.\\nWe define the identification rate by the relative frequency of correct recalls of position\\ndata in the past 100 trials. In a typical example, it converged to about 83% around time\\n400. At time 400, the number of levels was 202, and the levels oftree were distributed in 522. Since the identification failures of 17% can be rejected by considering the trajectory, no\\npro blem arises in practical use. In order to improve the identification rate, the compression\\nratio of camera images must be loosened. Such possibility depends on improvement of the\\nhardware in the future.\\nFig. 8 shows an example of actual motion of the robot based on the database for obstacle\\navoiding movement and that for position identification. This example corresponds to a case\\nof moving from 14 to 23 in Fig. 5.

We give convergence rates for these algorithms and for the Jaakkola and Jordan (1999) algorithm, and verify\\nthese theoretical predictions empirically. We also present empirical results on the difficult QMR-DT network problem, obtaining performance\\nof the new algorithms roughly comparable to the Jaakkola and Jordan\\nalgorithm.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nThe graphical models formalism provides an appealing framework for the design and analysis of network-based learning and inference systems. The formalism endows graphs with\\na joint probability distribution and interprets most queries of interest as marginal or conditional probabilities under this joint. For a fixed model one is generally interested in the\\nconditional probability of an output given an input (for prediction), or an input conditional\\non the output (for diagnosis or control). During learning the focus is usually on the likelihood (a marginal probability), on the conditional probability of unobserved nodes given\\nobserved nodes (e.g., for an EM or gradient-based algorithm), or on the conditional probability of the parameters given the observed data (in a Bayesian setting).\\nIn all of these cases the key computational operation is that of marginalization. There are\\nseveral methods available for computing marginal probabilities in graphical models, most\\nof which involve some form of message-passing on the graph. Exact methods, while viable\\nin many interesting cases (involving sparse graphs), are infeasible in the dense graphs that\\nwe consider in the current paper. A number of approximation methods have evolved to treat\\nsuch cases; these include search-based methods, loopy propagation, stochastic sampling,\\nand variational methods.\\nVariational methods, the focus of the current paper, have been applied successfully to a\\nnumber of large-scale inference problems. In particular, Jaakkola and Jordan (1999) developed a variational inference method for the QMR-DT network, a benchmark network\\ninvolving over 4,000 nodes (see below). The variational method provided accurate approximation to posterior probabilities within a second of computer time. For this difficult\\n\\n\\x0cA. Y. Ng and M. 1. Jordan\\n\\n534\\n\\ninference problem exact methods are entirely infeasible (see below), loopy propagation\\ndoes not converge to correct posteriors (Murphy, Weiss, & Jordan, 1999), and stochastic\\nsampling methods are slow and unreliable (Jaakkola & Jordan, 1999).\\nA significant step forward in the understanding of variational inference was made by Kearns\\nand Saul (1998), who used large deviation techniques to analyze the convergence rate of\\na simplified variational inference algorithm. Imposing conditions on the magnitude of the\\nweights in the network, they established a 0 ( Jlog N / N) rate of convergence for the error\\nof their algorithm, where N is the fan-in.\\nIn the current paper we utilize techniques similar to those of Kearns and Saul to derive a\\nnew set of variational inference algorithms with rates that are faster than 0 ( Jlog N / N).\\nOur techniques also allow us to analyze the convergence rate of the Jaakkola and Jordan\\n(1999) algorithm. We test these algorithms on an idealized problem and verify that our\\nanalysis correctly predicts their rates of convergence. We then apply these algorithms to\\nthe difficult the QMR-DT network problem.\\n\\n2 Background\\n2.1\\n\\nThe QMR-DT network\\n\\nThe QMR-DT (Quick Medical Reference, Decision-Theoretic) network is a bipartite graph\\nwith approximately 600 top-level nodes di representing diseases and approximately 4000\\nlower-level nodes Ii representing findings (observed symptoms). All nodes are binaryvalued. Each disease is given a prior probability P(d i = 1), obtained from archival data,\\nand each finding is parameterized as a \"noisy-OR\" model:\\n\\nP(h = lid) = 1- e-(lio-L:jE\"i (lijd j\\n\\n,\\n\\nwhere 7T\\'i is the set of parent diseases for finding h and where the parameters\\nobtained from assessments by medical experts (see Shwe, et aI., 1991).\\nLetting\\n\\nZi\\n\\n=\\n\\nOiQ\\n\\nOij\\n\\nare\\n\\n+ I:jE 1l\\'i Oijdj , we have the following expression for the likelihood I :\\n(1)\\n\\nwhere the sum is a sum across the approximately 2600 configurations of the diseases. Note\\nthat the second product, a product over the negative findings, factorizes across the diseases\\ndj ; these factors can be absorbed into the priors P (dj ) and have no significant effect on the\\ncomplexity of inference. It is the positive findings which couple the diseases and prevent\\nthe sum from being distributed across the product.\\nGeneric exact algorithms such as the junction tree algorithm scale exponentially in the\\nsize of the maximal clique in a moralized, triangulated graph. Jaakkola and Jordan (1999)\\nfound cliques of more than 150 nodes in QMR-DT; this rules out the junction tree algorithm. Heckerman (1989) discovered a factorization specific to QMR-DT that reduces the\\ncomplexity substantially; however the resulting algorithm still scales exponentially in the\\nnumber of positive findings and is only feasible for a small subset of the benchmark cases.\\nI In this expression, the factors P( dj) are the probabilities associated with the (parent-less) disease\\nnodes, the factors (1 - e - Zi) are the probabilities of the (child) finding nodes that are observed to be\\nin their positive state, and the factors e -Zi are the probabilities of the negative findings. The resulting\\nproduct is the joint probability P(f, d), which is marginalized to obtain the likelihood P(f).\\n\\n\\x0cApproximate Inference Algorithms for Two-Layer Bayesian Networks\\n\\n2.2\\n\\n535\\n\\nThe Jaakkola and Jordan (JJ) algorithm\\n\\nJaakkola and Jordan (1999) proposed a variational algorithm for approximate inference in\\nthe QMR-DT setting. Briefly, their approach is to make use of the following variational\\ninequality:\\nwhere Ci is a deterministic function of Ai. This inequality holds for arbitrary values of\\nthe free \"variational parameter\" Ai. Substituting these variational upper bounds for the\\nprobabilities of positive findings in Eq. (1), one obtains a factorizable upper bound on the\\nlikelihood. Because of the factorizability, the sum across diseases can be distributed across\\nthe joint probability, yielding a product of sums rather than a sum of products. One then\\nminimizes the resulting expression with respect to the variational parameters to obtain the\\ntightest possible variational bound.\\n2.3\\n\\nThe Kearns and Saul (KS) algorithm\\n\\nA simplified variational algorithm was proposed by Kearns and Saul (1998), whose main\\ngoal was the theoretical analysis of the rates of convergence for variational algorithms. In\\ntheir approach, the local conditional probability for the finding Ii is approximated by its\\nvalue at a point a small distance Ci above or below (depending on whether upper or lower\\nbounds are desired) the mean input E[Zi]. This yields a variational algorithm in which the\\nvalues Ci are the variational parameters to be optimized. Under the assumption that the\\nweights Oij are bounded in magnitude by T / N, where T is a constant and N is the number\\nof parent (\"disease\") nodes, Kearns and Saul showed that the error in likelihood for their\\nalgorithm converges at a rate of O( Vlog N / N).\\n\\n3\\n\\nAlgorithms based on local expansions\\n\\nInspired by Kearns and Saul (1998), we describe the design of approximation algorithms\\nfor QMR-DT obtained by expansions around the mean input to the finding nodes. Rather\\nthan using point approximations as in the Kearns-Saul (KS) algorithm, we make use of\\nTaylor expansions. (See also Plefka (1982), and Barber and van de Laar (1999) for other\\nperturbational techniques.)\\nConsider a generalized QMR-DT architecture in which the noisy-OR model is replaced by a\\ngeneral function \\'IjJ( z) : R -t [0, 1] having uniformly bounded derivatives, i.e., \\\\\\'IjJ(i) (z) \\\\ :::;\\nB i . Define F(Zl, . .. , ZK) = rr~l (\\'IjJ(zi))fi rr~l (1 - \\'IjJ(Zd)l-fi so that the likelihood\\ncan be written as\\n(2)\\nP(f) = E{z;}[F(Zl\"\" ,ZK)].\\nAlso define /-ti\\n\\n= E[Zi] = Ow + 2:7=1 OijP(dj = 1).\\n\\nA simple mean-field-like approximation can be obtained by evaluating F at the mean values\\n\\nP(f) ~ F(/-t1, ... ,/-tK).\\nWe refer to this approximation as \"MF(O).\"\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nExpanding the function F to second order, and defining (i = Zi - /-ti, we have:\\nK\\n\\nP(f)\\n\\nE{fi} rF(jl) + L\\nL\\n\\n11 =1\\n\\n1 K\\nFi1\\n\\n(J1)(i 1 +\\n\\n21\\n\\nK\\n\\n.L L\\n\\nFid2 (J1)Eh (i2\\n\\n+\\n\\n11 =112=1\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\x0cA.

As in Kearns and Saul (1998),\\nour results are obtained under the assumption that the weights are of magnitude at most\\nO(lIN) (recall that N is the number of disease nodes). For large N, this assumption of\\n\"weak interactions\" implies that each Zi will be close to its mean value with high probability\\n(by the law of large numbers), and thereby gives justification to the use of local expansions\\nfor the probabilities of the findings.\\nDue to space constraints, the detailed proofs of the theorems given in this section are deferred to the long version of this paper, and we will instead only sketch the intuitions for\\nthe proofs here.\\n\\nTheorem 1 Let K (the number offindings) be fixed, and suppose IfJ ij I :::;\\n\\n~\\n\\nfor all i, j for\\n\\nsome fixed constantT. Then the absolute error ofthe MF(k) approximation is 0 (N(!:!1)/2)\\nfor k odd and 0 (N(k72+1) ) for k even.\\n\\nProof intuition. First consider the case of odd k. Since IfJ ij I :::; ~, the quantity Ei = Zi J-Li = 2: j fJ ij (dj - E[ dj ]) is like an average of N random variables, and hence has standard\\ndeviation on the order 11m. Since MF(k) matches F up to the k-th order derivatives, we\\nfind that when we take a Taylor expansion ofMF(k)\\'s error, the leading non-zero term is the\\nk + 1-st order term, which contains quantities such as 10:+1. Now because Ei has standard\\ndeviation on the order 11m, it is unsurprising that E[E:+l] is on the order 1IN(k+l)/2,\\nwhich gives the error of MF(k) for odd k.\\nFor k even, the leading non-zero term in the Taylor expansion of the error is a k + 1-st order\\nterm with quantities such as 10:+1. But if we think of Ei as converging (via a central limit\\ntheorem effect) to a symmetric distribution, then since symmetric distributions have small\\nodd central moments, E[ 10:+1] would be small. This means that for k even, we may look to\\nthe order k + 2 term for the error, which leads to MF(k) having the the same big-O error as\\nMF(k + 1). Note this is also consistent with how MF(O) and MF(l) always give the same\\nestimates and hence have the same absolute error.\\n0\\nA theorem may also be proved for the convergence rate of the Jaakkola and Jordan (JJ)\\nalgorithm. For simplicity, we state it here only for noisy-OR networks. 2 A closely related\\nresult also holds for sigmoid networks with suitably modified assumptions; see the full\\npaper.\\n\\nTheorem 2 Let K befixed, and suppose \\'Ij;(z) = 1-e- z is the noisy-ORfunction. Suppose\\nfurther that 0 :::; fJ ij :::; ~ for all i, j for some fixed constant T, and that J-Li ~ J-Lmin for all\\ni, for some fixed J-Lmin > O. Then the absolute error of the JJ approximation is 0 (~ ).\\n2Note in any case that 11 can be applied only when 1/J is log-concave, such as in noisy-OR networks\\n(where incidentally all weights are non-negative).\\n\\n\\x0c537\\n\\nApproximate Inference Algorithms for Two-Layer Bayesian Networks\\n\\nThe condition of some Pmin lowerbounding the Pi\\'S ensures that the findings are not too\\nunlikely; for it to hold, it is sufficient that there be bias (\"leak\") nodes in the network with\\nweights bounded away from zero.\\n\\nProof intuition. Neglecting negative findings, (which as discussed do not need to be handled variationally,) this result is proved for a \"simplified\" version of the JJ algorithm, that\\nalways chooses the variational parameters so that for each i, the exponential upperbound\\non \\'1/J(Zi) is tangent to \\'1/J at Zi = Pi. (The \"normal\" version of JJ can have error no worse\\nthan this simplified one.) Taking a Tay lor expansion again of the approximation\\'s error, we\\nfind that since the upperbound has matched zeroth and first derivatives with F, the error is\\nAs discussed in the MF(k) proof outline,\\na second order term with quantities such as\\nthis quantity has expectation on the order 1jN, and hence JJ\\'s error is O(ljN).\\n0\\n\\nf.t.\\n\\nTo summarize our results in the most useful cases, we find that MF(O) has a convergence\\nrate of O(ljN) , both MF(2) and MF(3) have rates of O(ljN2) , and JJ has a convergence\\nrate of O(ljN).\\n\\n4 Simulation results\\n4.1\\n\\nArtificial networks\\n\\nWe carried out a set of simulations that were intended to verify the theoretical results presented in the previous section. We used bipartite noisy-OR networks, with full connectivity\\nbetween layers and with the weights ()ij chosen uniformly in (0, 2jN). The number N of\\ntop-level (\"disease\") nodes ranged from 10 to 1000. Priors on the disease nodes were\\nchosen uniformly in (0,1).\\nThe results are shown in Figure 1 for one and five positive findings (similar results where\\nobtained for additional positive findings).\\n100 r--_\\n\\n_ _ _ _~------___.\\n\\n-..._--_._---...\\n\\n--..... _--... -.\\n\\n10?\\' -- - - - - - __ _\\n\\n10?\\' ....?. ...... .... . .. . ............... ... .. ....\\n\\n...\\ne\\nw10\\'\\n1t\\nth\\n\\n10\\n\\n100\\n\\n#diseases\\n\\n1000\\n\\n10\\n\\n100\\n\\n1000\\n\\n#diseases\\n\\nFigure 1: Absolute error in likelihood (averaged over many randomly generated networks) as a function of the number of disease nodes for various algorithms.

For example, consider a 3-layer\\nnetwork with nodes bi being parents of nodes d i being parents of nodes Ii. To approximate\\nPr[J] using (say) MF(2), we first write Pr[J] as an expectation of a function (F) of the\\nZi\\'S, and approximate this function via a second-order Taylor expansion. To calculate the\\nexpectation of the Taylor approximation, we need to calculate terms in the expansion such\\nas E[d i ], E[didj ] and E[dn When di had no parents, these quantities were easily derived in\\nterms of the disease prior probabilities. Now, they instead depend on the joint distribution\\nof d i and d j , which we use our two-layer version of MF(k), applied to the first two (b i and\\ndi ) layers of the network, to approximate. It is important future work to carefully study the\\nperformance of this algorithm in the multilayer setting.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe wish to acknowledge the helpful advice of Tommi Jaakkola, Michael Kearns, Kevin\\nMurphy, and Larry Saul.\\nReferences\\n[1] Barber, D., & van de Laar, P.
